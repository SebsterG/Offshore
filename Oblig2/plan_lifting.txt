- Load out
	- Lifting from shore to vessel
	- Plan the deck space
- Transportation
	- Determine maximum sea state
	- Proper fastening
	- Check damages
	- Deck tilt at sea
- Lifting from deck
	- Test lowering on shore
	- Pendulum oscilations may occur due to waves or a shift of high amounts of weight. Dynamic forces
- Splash , lowering into water
	- When the module is lowered into the water, and the crane/boat moves, high amounts of stress can be induced
	- Water has to fill the "air gaps", and this has to be done slowely
- Further lowering
	- For deep lowering, wire weight may be an issue.
	- Calculate sufficient height above sea floor for dropping anchor
- Landing
